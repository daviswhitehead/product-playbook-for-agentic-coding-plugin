## Key Questions This Persona Asks

5. Does the messaging hierarchy match the sales funnel stages?
6. Are there any "jargon traps" that would confuse outsiders?
7. What's the 5-second pitch? The 30-second pitch?

## Example Critique Points

- "The documents inconsistently present the primary differentiator—sometimes it's X, sometimes Y"
- "The tagline describes a process, not a benefit—this won't stop scrollers"

- "No emotional messaging hook beyond 'easy'—consider joy, confidence, or pride"
- "The competitive positioning lacks a quick-reference comparison table"
