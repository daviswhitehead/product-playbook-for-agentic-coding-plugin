<!--
TEMPLATE GUIDANCE (for agents — do not include this block in output):

This template structures research findings into a strategic narrative that
bridges raw data and product decisions. It's the layer between "what we know"
and "what we should build."

The three-layer research approach (Quantitative + Qualitative + Product Taste)
prevents biased decisions by combining different types of evidence.

Adapt this template:
- Not every project has all three research types. Use what's available.
- The Opportunities section is the most important output — it's what
  drives prioritization and PRDs downstream.
- Sources should be explicit and traceable.

# Research Synthesis

> [Brief note on what research was conducted, what it covers, and how it should inform product decisions.]

---

## Research Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Product/Project** | [Name] |
| **Date** | [Date range of research] |
| **Research Types** | [Quantitative / Qualitative / Product Taste — which were used] |
| **Key Question** | [The primary question this research aimed to answer] |

---

## Quantitative Insights

<!-- Data-driven findings from analytics, metrics, experiments, surveys.
     Each insight should include the data point, source, and what it implies. -->

### Key Findings

| # | Finding | Data | Source | Implication |
|---|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | [What the data shows] | [Specific numbers] | [Analytics tool, dataset] | [What this means for the product] |
| 2 | [What the data shows] | [Specific numbers] | [Analytics tool, dataset] | [What this means for the product] |
| 3 | [What the data shows] | [Specific numbers] | [Analytics tool, dataset] | [What this means for the product] |

### Data Gaps

- [What data would be valuable but wasn't available]
- [Questions the data couldn't answer]

---

## Qualitative Insights

<!-- Findings from user research, interviews, feedback, support tickets, reviews.
     Each insight should include a representative quote and source. -->

### Key Themes

**Theme 1: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences summarizing the theme]

> "[Representative quote]"
> *Source: [Interview/survey/review source]*

**Theme 2: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences summarizing the theme]

> "[Representative quote]"
> *Source: [Interview/survey/review source]*

**Theme 3: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences summarizing the theme]

> "[Representative quote]"
> *Source: [Interview/survey/review source]*

### Research Gaps

- [What user segments weren't represented]
- [Questions that need deeper exploration]

---

## Product Taste / Critique *(Optional)*

<!-- Insights from hands-on product experience, competitive analysis, UX review,
     design critique. This is the "judgment" layer — informed opinion grounded
     in product experience. -->

### Product Experience Insights

- [Insight from using the product]: [What it means]
- [Insight from using the product]: [What it means]

### Competitive Observations

| Competitor | What They Do Well | Where They Fall Short | Lesson for Us |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| [Product 1] | [Strength] | [Weakness] | [What we learn] |
| [Product 2] | [Strength] | [Weakness] | [What we learn] |

### Design / UX Critique

- [Observation about current UX]: [Implication]
- [Observation about current UX]: [Implication]

## Cross-Layer Synthesis

<!-- This is where the three layers come together. What patterns emerge when
     you look across quantitative, qualitative, and taste insights? -->

### Converging Signals

Where multiple research types point in the same direction:

| Signal | Quantitative Evidence | Qualitative Evidence | Taste/Critique Evidence |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| [Signal 1] | [Data] | [Quotes/themes] | [Observations] |
| [Signal 2] | [Data] | [Quotes/themes] | [Observations] |

### Diverging Signals

Where research types contradict each other (these need resolution):

| Signal | What Data Says | What Users Say | What Taste Says | Resolution Needed |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Signal] | [Data perspective] | [User perspective] | [Critique perspective] | [What to investigate] |

---

## Opportunities

<!-- THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. This transforms research into strategic
     opportunities that drive prioritization and PRDs.

     Each opportunity should be:
     - Grounded in evidence from the research above
     - Connected to strategy foundations (if they exist)
     - Sized by potential impact
     - Clear enough to generate product ideas from -->

### Opportunity 1: [Name]

**Insight:** [What the research revealed]

**Evidence:**
- Quantitative: [Supporting data]
- Qualitative: [Supporting quotes/themes]
- Taste: [Supporting observations]

**Strategic Connection:** [How this connects to mission/vision/personas/retention framework — reference foundations if they exist]

**Potential Impact:** [High / Medium / Low] — [Brief justification]

**Product Direction:** [What kinds of solutions could address this opportunity]

### Opportunity 2: [Name]

**Insight:** [What the research revealed]

**Evidence:**
- Quantitative: [Supporting data]
- Qualitative: [Supporting quotes/themes]
- Taste: [Supporting observations]

**Strategic Connection:** [How this connects to broader strategy]

**Potential Impact:** [High / Medium / Low] — [Brief justification]

**Product Direction:** [What kinds of solutions could address this]

### Opportunity 3: [Name]

[Same structure]

---

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Basis | What Would Increase Confidence |
|------|------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| [Opportunity 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [Why] | [What additional research would help] |
| [Opportunity 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [Why] | [What additional research would help] |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- [What should happen now based on this research]

### Further Research Needed
- [What questions remain unanswered]
- [What additional data would strengthen decisions]

### Next Steps
- [Prioritization of opportunities → `/playbook:product-requirements`]
- [Additional research to conduct]

## Sources Index

| Source | Type | Date | Sections Informed |
|--------|------|------|-------------------|
| [Source 1] | [Quantitative/Qualitative/Taste] | [Date] | [Which sections] |
| [Source 2] | [Quantitative/Qualitative/Taste] | [Date] | [Which sections] |

---

*Research synthesis transforms data into decisions. The Opportunities section is the bridge between "what we know" and "what we should build."*
