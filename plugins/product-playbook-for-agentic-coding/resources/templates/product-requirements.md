### Project Size Guidelines
Project size determines the complexity and depth of planning required:

**Small Projects**:
- Simple, focused features or bug fixes
- 1-3 components or services
- Limited external dependencies
- Straightforward technical approach
- Estimated timeline: Days to 1-2 weeks

**Medium Projects**:
- Multiple components or features
- Some external integrations
- Moderate technical complexity
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, data, UI)
- Estimated timeline: 2-4 weeks to 2 months

**Large Projects**:
- Complex systems with many components
- Multiple external integrations
- Significant technical challenges
- Multiple subsystems or services
- Estimated timeline: 2+ months

- [ ] [Indicator 2: e.g., Usage patterns]

## Design Considerations
**UX Implications**:
- [ ] [UX consideration 1]
- [ ] [UX consideration 2]

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- [ ] [Accessibility requirement 1]
- [ ] [Accessibility requirement 2]

**Design Constraints**:
- [ ] [Constraint 1]
- [ ] [Constraint 2]

## Constraints and Assumptions
**Technical Constraints**:
- [ ] [Technology stack limitations]
- [ ] [Performance requirements]
- [ ] [Integration requirements]

- [ ] [Budget limitations]
- [ ] [Timeline constraints]
- [ ] [Resource availability]

**Assumptions**:
- [ ] [Key assumption about users, market, technology]

## Non-Goals
**What are we NOT building?**
- [ ] [Feature 1: e.g., Mobile app in v1]
- [ ] [Feature 2: e.g., Advanced analytics]
- [ ] [Feature 3: e.g., Multi-tenant support]

**Why are these out of scope?**
[Rationale for exclusions]

## User Stories (Optional)
**As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]**

1. [User story 1]
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] [Criteria 1]
     - [ ] [Criteria 2]

2. [User story 2]
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] [Criteria 1]
     - [ ] [Criteria 2]

## Risks and Mitigation
**High-Risk Items**:
- [ ] [Risk 1: Description and mitigation strategy]
- [ ] [Risk 2: Description and mitigation strategy]

## External Dependencies

> **Guidance**: Default to NON-BLOCKING for external reviews and approvals. Ship with automated verification, then incorporate expert feedback in a follow-up release. Only make blocking if: regulatory requirement OR safety-critical.

| Dependency | Blocking? | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| [e.g., Design review] | Non-blocking | Automated tests provide adequate initial coverage |
| [e.g., Security audit] | Blocking | Handles user credentials — requires sign-off |
