### Chat Session Learnings
*Use when capturing lightweight learnings after a coding session*
- Quick insight or pattern discovered
- Documentation gap found
- Tool improvement idea

### Project Completion Learnings
*Use for comprehensive retrospective after completing a project*
- Full project summary and outcomes
- Process improvements identified
- Template refinements needed

### Blocker Overcome Learnings
*Use immediately after solving a hard problem*
- What was painful
- How it was solved
- How to prevent next time

## Learning Target
