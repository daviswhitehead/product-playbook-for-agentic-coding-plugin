<!--
TEMPLATE GUIDANCE (for agents — do not include this block in output):

This template provides a strategy stack — a sequence of foundation documents
that anchor all downstream product decisions. Each section builds on the previous.

Adapt this template to the project:
- Not every project needs every section. A small feature may only need Personas
  and a brief Problem Statement. A new product needs the full stack.
- Sections marked "Optional" can be omitted for smaller projects.
- The order matters: earlier sections inform later ones.
- These documents are living artifacts — update them as understanding deepens.

The strategy stack becomes a decision filter: every product idea, PRD, and
prioritization decision should trace back to these foundations.

# Strategy Foundations

> [Brief note on what this document covers and how it should be used. Example: "These foundations capture our strategic thinking for [Product/Project]. They serve as the decision filter for all downstream product work — every idea we pursue should trace back to something here."]

---

## Mission

**Why does this product/team exist?**

> [One sentence that captures the core purpose. Not what you do — why you do it.]

**Sources:** [What informed this — founder interviews, company docs, etc.]

---

## Vision

**Where are we going in 2-5 years?**

> [2-3 sentences painting a picture of the future state. Ambitious but grounded. Should make someone excited about the direction.]

**Sources:** [What informed this]

---

## Core Promise *(Optional)*

**What do we deliver that no one else does?**

> [One sentence that captures the unique value proposition. What would users miss most if the product disappeared?]

**How we deliver on it:**
- [Specific way the product delivers on this promise]
- [Another specific way]
- [Another specific way]

---

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**

[2-3 sentences describing the core problem. Be specific about who has this problem and why existing solutions fall short.]

**Evidence:**

| Signal | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [Data point or quote] | [Value] | [Source] |
| [Data point or quote] | [Value] | [Source] |

## Personas

<!-- Adapt: Create as many personas as the project needs. For a focused feature,
     1-2 may suffice. For a full product strategy, 3-5 is typical. -->

### [Persona Name]

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Who** | [Brief description — role, context, demographics] |
| **Goal** | [What they're trying to accomplish] |
| **Pain Point** | [What frustrates them about current solutions] |
| **Behavior** | [How they currently solve this problem] |
| **Success Looks Like** | [What a great outcome means for them] |

### [Persona Name]

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Who** | [Brief description] |
| **Goal** | [What they're trying to accomplish] |
| **Pain Point** | [What frustrates them] |
| **Behavior** | [How they currently solve this] |

## Value Propositions *(Optional)*

<!-- What specific value does the product deliver? Map each to personas. -->

| Value Proposition | Description | Primary Persona | How We Deliver |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Value 1] | [What it means for users] | [Persona] | [How the product delivers this] |
| [Value 2] | [What it means for users] | [Persona] | [How the product delivers this] |

## Retention / Engagement Framework *(Optional)*

<!-- Adapt: Use the framework that fits your product. Common options:
     - Retention moments (Setup → Aha → Habit)
     - AARRR (Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral)
     - Jobs-to-be-Done framework
     - Custom framework

     The Shortform case study used "retention moments" with letter grades. -->

### Key Moments

| Moment | Definition | Metric | Current Grade | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **[Moment 1]** (e.g., Setup) | [What the user does / experiences] | [How to measure] | [Current state] | [Target] |
| **[Moment 2]** (e.g., Aha) | [What the user does / experiences] | [How to measure] | [Current state] | [Target] |
| **[Moment 3]** (e.g., Habit) | [What the user does / experiences] | [How to measure] | [Current state] | [Target] |

### Moment-to-Value Mapping *(Optional)*

| Moment | Value Proposition Delivered | Persona | Key Actions |
|--------|----------------------------|---------|-------------|
