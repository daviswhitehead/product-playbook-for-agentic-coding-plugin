# Tasks

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: [Project Name]
**Tech Plan**: [Link to Tech Plan]
**Date**: [Date]
**Version**: [Version]

## Current Focus

**Active Task**: [Task X.Y - Task Name]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete
- **Current Subtasks**:
  - [ ] [Subtask 1]
  - [ ] [Subtask 2]
  - [ ] [Subtask 3]

**Next Task**: [Task X.Y - Task Name] (Ready when [dependency] is complete)

## Task Completion Workflow

**After completing each task, update this document:**
1. Mark task status as "Complete"
2. Verify ALL acceptance criteria checkboxes are marked
3. Add completion notes (what was done, any learnings, blockers resolved)
4. Update "Current Focus" section to next task
5. Update "Progress Tracking" section below

**Before marking any task complete:**
- Verify all acceptance criteria are checked
- Verify all dependencies are satisfied
- Add completion notes documenting what was accomplished

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]
